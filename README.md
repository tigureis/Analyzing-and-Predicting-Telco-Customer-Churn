# Telco Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting customer churn within the telecommunications industry using a publicly available dataset. The goal is to identify key factors driving churn and build a predictive model to identify customers at risk of leaving.

## Dataset

The analysis utilizes the "Telco_customer_churn.xlsx" dataset, publicly available through IBM. It contains information about Telco customers, including demographics, services subscribed, and churn status.

## Methodology

The notebook follows these key steps:

1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning:** The dataset is loaded, explored using Pandas, and preprocessed to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
2. **Feature Engineering:** New features are derived from existing data to improve model performance.
3. **Feature Selection:** Important features are identified using techniques such as mutual information to reduce dimensionality.
4. **Model Building:** Machine learning models are trained on the preprocessed data to predict customer churn.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are used to assess the model's effectiveness.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you'll need:

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Ydata-profiling

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook and run the cells sequentially.

## Results

The project provides insights into the factors influencing customer churn and demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in predicting churn risk. The findings can be used by Telco companies to develop strategies for customer retention.
